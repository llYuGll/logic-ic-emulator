# 🔩 Logic IC Emulator

A Verilog-based emulator for classic 74-series logic ICs, designed to help students and hobbyists explore digital design both conceptually and practically.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Practice and strengthen** my Verilog + Digital Design fundamentals.
2. **Build a useful resource** for students to simulate and understand how common logic ICs work — from RTL-level code to real-world usage.
3. Help bridge the gap between **IC datasheets, circuit-level applications, and Verilog simulation**.

## 📦 What Will This Repo Contain?

Over the next 2–3 weeks, I will continue adding:

- ✅ Verilog modules for commonly used 74-series logic ICs
- ✅ Testbenches and waveform outputs for validation
- ✅ Example mini-projects using these ICs (shared via KiCAD schematics or hand-drawn diagrams)
- ✅ Original datasheets for reference

---

## 🔄 Flow of Each IC Module

For every IC I add, the structure will follow:

1. **IC Verilog implementation**
2. **Testbench for simulation**
3. **Waveform screenshot (.vcd or image)**
4. **Example project using that IC**
5. **TI Datasheet reference**

## 📝 Notes

- This README will be **updated regularly** as the project grows.
- I appreciate suggestions, feedback, or collaboration ideas! Feel free to open issues or message me.
