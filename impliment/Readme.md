#About This Project

This section includes important digital circuits and some advanced implementations that electronics and electrical students often work with during their digital design journey.


You could write these codes at the RTL level, but here Iâ€™m using real modules like D flip-flops, logic gates, and other ICs hence i have decided to use gate level modelling. This way, you get to see how things would actually work on a breadboard or in a real circuit. If you want to try these out yourself, just read each line and you will get how the circuit is actually working as everything is described at gate level. For required ICs and how they work check out my RTL section.


This is especially helpful for 2nd year students at BITS and other colleges, where you often need to build circuits using physical ICs to create things like finite state machines (FSMs).

Ill try to implement using both melay and moore FSMs wherever possible.

At the end ill add a separate read.md for each type of FSMs where i ll explain how i arrived at gate level diagram, but expect it at later stages of the project as it will consume lot of time.
